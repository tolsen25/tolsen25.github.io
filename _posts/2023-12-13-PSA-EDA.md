## Introduction
There are over a hundred years of baseball cards with hundreds if not thousands of sets in each year.  Thus with a dataset so large it is impossible to explore all the data in one EDA.  This EDA will focus only on uncovering the broadest trends of the data and leave further analysis for other projects.

## Part 1 
#### The explosion of sets
For the majority of the history of baseball cards there have only been a handful of popular sets (with lots of other smaller sets).  However since the end of World War II the number of sets has grown substantially, but in recent years has gone up and down.

Interestingly there was a down turn in the mid 2000's around the time of the recession.
