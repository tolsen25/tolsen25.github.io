## Introduction
There are over a hundred years of baseball cards with hundreds if not thousands of sets in each year.  Thus with a dataset so large it is impossible to explore all the data in one EDA.  This EDA will focus only on uncovering the broadest trends of the data and leave further analysis for other projects.

### Part 1 
#### The explosion of sets
For the majority of the history of baseball cards there have only been a handful of popular sets (with lots of other smaller sets).  However since the end of World War II the number of sets has grown substantially, but in recent years has gone up and down.

Interestingly there was a down turn in the mid 2000's around the time of the recession.
##### Question 1: Is there a link between the economy and the number of sets produced?

### Part 2
#### Vintage is King 
Despite being from yesteryear, the most commonly graded cards came from 1975 or earlier.

##### Question 2: What cards make these sets so popular to grade?

### Part 3
#### Steady increase of Gem Mint percentage.
As expected the more recent the card, the higher the Gem Mint percentage (i.e. a perfect card).

### Part 4
#### Wide scatterplots

This scatterplot reveals that while the general trend is that older sets tend to have a lower gem percentage, there are many older sets that have higher gem-percentages than their peers. 

## Conclusion
While the possibilities are endless, this EDA revealed a handful of trends about baseball cards and the PSA pop count of baseball cards. These takeaways could be used as the genesis of further analysis
1) The number of sets does not always increase from year to year, some years it goes down significantly
2) The most commonly graded cards are vintage cards
3) Gem Mint Percentage has risen over time
4) Some sets are trend-breakers for their age.
