## Introduction
There are over a hundred years of baseball cards with hundreds if not thousands of sets in each year.  Thus with a dataset so large it is impossible to explore all the data in one EDA.  This EDA will focus only on uncovering the broadest trends of the data and leave further analysis for other projects.

### Part 1 
#### The explosion of sets
For the majority of the history of baseball cards there have only been a handful of popular sets (with lots of other smaller sets).  However since the end of World War II the number of sets has grown substantially, but in recent years has gone up and down.

Interestingly there was a down turn in the mid 2000's.  This is mostly likley due to due Upper Deck, a major card company losing the rights to produce baseball cards with MLB team logos.


### Part 2: Vintage is King 
***
Despite being from yesteryear, the most commonly graded cards came from 1975 or earlier.

The popularity of the year likely has a lot to do with the events of that year.  For example, in 1961 Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle were chasing Babe Ruth's record for home run's in a year.  Roger Maris ended up breaking the record on the last day of the season.  The popularity of the set also depends on the rookie class and the number of stars in the set.  1961 Topps has stars such as Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Hank Aaron, and Willie Mays.

### Part 3
#### Steady increase of Gem Mint percentage.
As expected the more recent the card, the higher the Gem Mint percentage (i.e. a perfect card).

### Part 4
#### Wide scatterplots
In order to see the relation between time and the gem mint percentage I created a scatterplot that had the `Years Ago from 2023` on the x-axis and the `Gem Mint %` on the y-axis.  Each datapoint represents a set.

This scatterplot reveals that while the general trend is that older sets tend to have a lower gem percentage, there are many older sets that have higher gem-percentages than their peers. 

## Part 5
#### Rise in average grade
In order to see how the average grade is overall over time, I found the average grade for each year and plotted it against time.

This plot shows a general increase in `Average Grade` over time. This is to be expected, but this plot could be modified to include only certain years so spikes can be further analyzed.

## Conclusion
While the possibilities are endless, this EDA revealed a handful of trends about baseball cards and the PSA pop count of baseball cards. These takeaways could be used as the genesis of further analysis
1) The number of sets does not always increase from year to year, some years it goes down significantly
2) The most commonly graded cards are vintage cards
3) Gem Mint Percentage has risen over time
4) Some sets are trend-breakers for their age.
