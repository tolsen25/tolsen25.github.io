title: About Me
---

I am student graduating from Brigham Young University in April 2024.  Contact me at t.olsen18@outlook.com. 

I served a full time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints from 2019-2021 in Santiago Chile, and Salt Lake City Utah.  I enjoyed learning Spanish and connecting with people from various cultures and backgrounds.

I am a big sports fan of just about every type. My favorites though are baseball, college football and volleyball.
