### Work Experience
**BYU Center for Language Studies**
*Computer Programmer*
- Co-engineered a Qualtrics-to-AWS data pipeline that sends raw survey data to a machine learning algorithm and returns a final score in time to display at the end of the survey
- Developed an interactive R-Shiny Application for 10 language teachers to playback audio samples for all students (15-20) in their classes and download custom writing sample reports
- Created 4 ggplot2 visualizations for a research paper involving Likert-Scale and binary data
- Generated an R-markdown report for 10 teachers to view their students’ OPIc and self-assess data
- Downloaded and cleaned data from the Qualtrics API for researchers to analyze using ANOVA and machine learning
- Analyzed and visualized user data from a language learning program using “tidyverse” packages

### Machine Learning Projects
*Kobe Shot Selection Kaggle Competition* -- December 2023  

- Scored .60198 using R tidymodels Random Forests, target encoding, normalizing, and other feature engineering steps
  
*Amazon Employee Kaggle Competition* -- October 2023  

- Deployed Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Penalized Regression (LASSO, Ridge & Elastic Net) in R “tidymodels” to predict employee access
- Achieved a .886 (area under the curve) score using “tidymodels” random forests and cross-validation

*Bike Share Kaggle Competition* -- September 2023

- Predicted Bike-Share demand using BART, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Poisson Regression, and Penalized Regression (LASSO, Ridge & Elastic Net) in R “tidymodels”
- Achieved .402 Kaggle score (RMSLE) through BART

### Statistics Projects

*Bayesian Regression Analysis of Plate Discipline Data* -- March 2023
    
- Coordinated as a group the gathering, cleaning, and analysis of plate discipline data using the beta-binomial distribution 
- Concluded that there was a slight decrease in plate discipline in the second half of the season
